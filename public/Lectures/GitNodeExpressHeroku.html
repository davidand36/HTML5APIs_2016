      <h1>Git</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is a <em>version control</em> (a.k.a. <em>source control management</em>) system. All serious software projects use some VCS, and Git is one of the most modern and popular. Version control allows developers to keep track of the changes and versions of their code as they work. It facilitates collaboration. It also serves as a back-up system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The official Git Web site, linked above, has extensive documentation. Because it is widely used, you can find tutorials and answers to most questions by searching the Web. The book by Scott Chacon & Ben Straub, <em>Pro Git</em>, Apress, 2014 (<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/pro-git-scott-chacon/1100096071?ean=9781484200773" target="_blank">9781484200773</a> also <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2" target="_blank">free online</a>), is very good.
        </p>

      <h1>Node.js</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> is a command-line interpreter for JavaScript, based on the excellent V8 engine found in Google's Chrome and Chromium browsers. It allows desktops and servers to run JavaScript outside of the browser environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Node.js comes with many useful standard libraries, a.k.a. modules, which make it a good platform for many purposes. It is most commonly used to run Web servers, with the help of certain modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a wealth of books and resources about Node.js.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h1>Express</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> is a Web server framework that runs on Node.js. It has a very modular design, meaning that there is a large collection of modules that are typically added on to Express to enable the features one needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the books and articles about Node.js are also about Express, whose official Web site includes <a href="http://expressjs.com/resources/books-blogs.html" target="_blank">a list of books and blogs</a> that is a reasonable starting point.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h1>Heroku</h1>
      <div>
        <p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provider, which means that it provides a platform where developers can deploy Web applications. Heroku supports applications written in a variety of languages and frameworks, including Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Java, Python, and PHP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pricing varies depending on the scale of the application's resource requirements. For small projects where performance is not an issue, the service is free.
        </p>
