    <h1>HTML5 APIs Assignment 6: RESTful Data API</h1>

    <p>
      This week you will use the RESTful data API that I set up for you. But you have a choice: you can either make a page with separate forms for the CRUD operations, or you can implement a more polished app with a table and a single form.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the same objects you used for the the Object List assignment, with the same properties, or choose something new for your database.
    </p>

    <h2>REST Forms</h2>
    <p>
      Create a Web page with separate forms for each of the basic database operations, similar to the ones used in the lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll need forms for creating, reading, updating, and deleting and item. You should also have a button for listing all of the items.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each of the forms and button, the event handler should make the appropriate AJAX call. You can use <code>console.log()</code> to show the results, but it would be better to display them on the Web page as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your page might look something like this: <br/>
      <img src="RestForms.png" />
    </p>

    <h2>REST App</h2>
    <p>
      Create a Web app like the one for the Object List assignment with a table for the items and a form for creating and editing them. The only difference is that instead of keeping the database in an array in your app's memory, you will use the RESTful API to create items and list them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table might look like this: <br/>
      <img src="RestAppTable.png" /> <br/>
      Your form might look something like this: <br/>
      <img src="RestAppForm.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The edit and delete functionality are optional, but give it a shot.
